# Authentication💻

For the Authentication, I have used an amazing provider called Auth0.


## Why did I use Auth0
Auth0 provides the most extensive functionality which ensure the user authentication and authorization, with detailed analytics and a variety of available providers.

I noticed that there is a need to add social authentication to apps while I was practicing .Apparently I was looking for a solution and I came across Auth0. Its security, universality, and ease of use made me choose this for my Authentication .

After clicking the search button you will be redirected to the result page. The first thing which you will be seeing in the result page is a Dark themed map with a series of hotels. The map is handled by  [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/). 

MapBox is a alternative for google map which doesn't ask for any kind of details and we can style the map for our necessity. And the series of hotels is fetched from a fake json api which is possible with  [Jsonkeeper](https://jsonkeeper.com/)
